CGI::Widget::Tabs
=================



DESCRIPTION

CGI::Widget::Tabs lets you simulate tab widgets in HTML. You
could benefit from tabs if you want to serve only one page.
Depending on the tab selected you fetch and display the
underlying data. There are two main reasons for taking this
approach:

1. For the end user not to be directed to YAL or YAP (yet another
link / yet another page), but keep it all together: The single
point of entry paradigm.

2. For the Perl hacker to generate and display multiple data
sources within the same script environment.

The nice thing about CGI::Widget::Tabs is that the tabs now their
internal state. So you can ask a tab for instance which tab page
is highlighted. This way you get direct feedback on what the user
clicked.



EXAMPLES

     __________      __________      ____________      _______
    / Software \    / Hardware \    / Lease Cars \    / Xerox \
-------------------------------------------------------------------


     __________________      _________      ___________
    / Personal Details \    / Pension \    / Insurance \
------------------------------------------------------------


These trivial examples could be used in for instance a
maintenance application or a human resources application.
