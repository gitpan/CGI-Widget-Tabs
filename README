CGI::Widget::Tabs
=================



DESCRIPTION

CGI::Widget::Tabs lets you simulate tab widgets in HTML. You
could benefit from a tab widget if you want to serve only one
page. Depending on the tab selected you fetch and display the
underlying data. There are two main reasons for taking this
approach:

1. For the end user not to be directed to YAL or YAP (yet another
link / yet another page), but keep it all together: The single
point of entry paradigm.

2. For the Perl hacker to generate and display multiple data
sources within the same script environment.


As an example the following tabs could be used on a web page for
someone's spotting hobby:

      ________      ________      _____________
     / Planes \    / Trains \    / Automobiles \
-----------------------------------------------------

The nice thing about CGI::Widget::Tabs is that the tabs know
their internal state. So you can ask a tab for instance which tab
heading has been clicked by the user. This way you get instant
feedback.

1.3 (2002-11-12)
----------------
Continuous discussions with Sagar Shah <sagarshah@softhome.net>
had made me (finally) realize that CGI::Widget::Tabs can't be
extended without serious design change. (Is everybody so
stubborn, or is it just me?) Well, here it is Sagar :-)

- Added an OO interface as a basis for future extensions of tab
  headings.
- OO headings can be configured with the new methods:
      text()       HTML escaped heading text
      raw_text()   HTML unescaped heading text
      key()        Value to be used as CGI query param value
      url()        Redirection URL
- Documentation additions, changes and fixes.
- Small change to the layout of the HTML table displaying the
  widget
- The test script (`make test') now supports both CGI and
  CGI::Minimal
