        $tab->cgi_param("t");        # the CGI query parameter to use
        $tab->drop_params("ays");    # do NOT pass on "Are You Sure?" answers
        $tab->wrap(4);               # wrap after 4 headings...
        $tab->indent(1);             # ...and add indentation
        $tab->render;                # the resulting HTML code
        $tab->display;               # same as `print $tab->render'

        $h = $tab->heading;               # new OO heading for this tab
        $h->text("TV Listings");          # heading text
        $h->key("tv");                    # key identifying this heading
        $h->raw(1);                       # switch off HTML encoding
        $h->url("whatsontonight.com");    # redirect URL for this heading
        $h->class("red");                 # this heading has it's own class

        # See the EXAMPLE section for a complete example

DESCRIPTION
  Introduction
    CGI::Widget::Tabs lets you simulate tab widgets in HTML. You could
    benefit from a tab widget if you want to serve only one page. Depending
    on the tab selected you fetch and display the underlying data. There are
    three main reasons for taking this approach:

    1. For the end user not to be directed to YAL or YAP (yet another link /
    yet another page), but keep it all together: The single point of entry
    paradigm.

    2. As a consequence the end user deals with a more consistent and
    integrated GUI. This will give a better "situational awareness" within
    the application.

    3. For the Perl hacker to handle multiple related data sources within
    the same script environment.

    As an example the following tabs could be used on a web page for
    someone's spotting hobby:

          __________      __________      __________
         /  Planes  \    /  Trains  \    / Classics \
    ------------------------------------------------------
             _________
            /  Bikes  \
    ------------------------

    As you can see, the headings wrap at three and a small indentation is
    added to the start of the next row. The nice thing about
    CGI::Widget::Tabs is that the tabs know their internal state. So you can
    ask a tab for instance which heading has been clicked by the user. This
    way you get instant feedback.

  "Hey Gorgeous!"
    Of course tabs are useless if you can't "see" them. Without proper make
    up they print as ordinary text. So you really need to fancy them up with
    some eye candy. The designed way is that you provide a CSS style sheet
    and have CGI::Widget::Tabs use that. See the class() method for how to
    do this.

EXAMPLE
    Before digging into the API and all accessor methods, this example will
    illustrate how to implement the spotting page from above. So you have
    something to start with. It will give you enough clues to get on the
    road quickly. The following code is a simple but complete example. Copy
    it and run it through the webservers CGI engine. (For a even more
    complete and useful demo with multiple tabs, see the file tabs-demo.pl
    in the CGI::Widget::Tabs installation directory.) To fully appreciate
    it, it would be best to run it in a performance environment, like
    mod_perl or SpeedyCGI.

        #! /usr/bin/perl -w

        use CGI::Widget::Tabs;
        use CGI;

        print <<EOT;
        Content-Type: text/html;

        <head>
        <style type="text/css">
        table.tab   { border-bottom: solid thin #C0D4E6; text-align: center }
        td.tab      { padding: 2 12 2 12; width: 80; background-color: #FAFAD2 }
        td.tab_actv { padding: 2 12 2 12; width: 80; background-color: #C0D4E6 }
        td.tab_spc  { width: 5 }
        td.tab_ind  { width: 15 }
        </style></head>
        <body>
        EOT

        my $cgi = CGI->new;
        my $tab = CGI::Widget::Tabs->new;
        $tab->cgi_object($cgi);
        $tab->headings( qw/Planes Traines Classics Bikes/ );
        $tab->wrap(3);
        # $tab->wrap(1);    # |uncomment to see the effect of
        # $tab->indent(0);  # |wrapping at 1 without indentation
        $tab->default("Traines");
        $tab->display;
        print "<br>We now should run some intelligent code ";
        print "to process <strong>", $tab->active, "</strong><br>";
        print "</body></html>";

PUBLIC INTERFACE
  Public Class Interface
   new
      new()

    Creates and returns a new CGI::Widget::Tabs object. new() does not take
    any arguments.

  Public Object Interface
   active
     active()

    Returns a string indicating the current active tab heading. This is (in
    order of precedence) the heading being clicked on, the default heading,
    or the first in the list. The string value will either be the heading
    key or the heading text, depending on if you chose to use keys. Example:

        if ( $tab->active() eq "Trains" ) {  # heading text only

        if ( $tab->active() eq "-t" ) {      # key value ISO heading text

   cgi_object
     cgi_object(OBJECT)

    Sets/returns the CGI or CGI::Minimal object. If the optional argument
    OBJECT is given, the CGI object is set, otherwise it is returned.
    CGI::Widget::Tabs uses this object internally to process the CGI query
    parameters. If you want you can use some other CGI object handler.
    However such an object handler must provide a param() method with
    corresponding behaviour as do CGI or CGI::Minimal. Note that currently
    only CGI and CGI::Minimal have been tested. Example:

        # set
        my $cgi = CGI::Minimal->new;
        $tab->cgi_object($cgi);

        # get
        my $cgi = $tab->cgi_object;

   cgi_param
      cgi_param(STRING)

    Sets/returns the CGI query parameter. This parameter identifies the tab
    in the CGI query string (the funny part of the URL with the ? = & #
    characters). If the optional argument STRING is given, the query
    parameter is set. Otherwise it is returned. Usually you can leave this
    untouched. In that case the default parameter "tab" is used. You will
    need to set this if you have more CGI query parameters on the URL with
    "tab" already being taken. Another situation is if you use multiple tab
    widgets on one page. They both would use "tab" by default causing
    conflicts. Example:

       # Lets paint a fruit tab and a vegetable tab
       my $fruits_tab = CGI::Widget::Tabs->new;
       my $vegies_tab = CGI::Widget::Tabs->new;

       # this is our link with the outside world
       my $cgi = CGI::Minimal->new;
       $fruits_tab->cgi_object($cgi);
       $vegies_tab->cgi_object($cgi);

       # In the CGI params collection the first is
       # identified by 'ft' and the second by 'vt'
       $fruits_tab->cgi_param("ft");
       $vegies_tab->cgi_param("vt");

   drop_params
      drop_params(LIST)

    Sets/retrieves the list of CGI parameters to be dropped from the
    parameter list. If the optional argument LIST is given the list is set,
    otherwise it is retrieved. Suppose you have clicked "Yes" to some "Are
    you sure?" question. You certainly want that question to be asked every
    time, right? Especially if the actions that go with it are destructive.
    If you did NOT specify the parameter to be dropped, "Yes" would have
    been silently passed on to the parameter list. That would effectively
    preset "Are you sure" with "Yes" causing disastrous results. Examples:

        $tab->drop_params("ays");  # drop the "Are you sure" param

   class
      class(STRING)

    Sets/returns the name of the CSS class used for the tabs markup. If the
    optional argument STRING is given the class is set, otherwise it is
    returned. If not set, the widget will be based on the class "tab". In
    the accompanying style sheet, there are five class elements you need to
    provide:

    1. A table element for containment of the entire tab widget
    2. A td element for a normal tab
    3. A td element for the active tab
    4. A td element for the spacers
    5. A td element for the indentation (if needed)

    The class names of these elements are directly borrowed from the class()
    method. The td elements for the active tab, the spacers and the
    indentations are suffixed with "_actv", "_spc" and "_ind" respectively.
    For instance, if you'd run

        $tab->class("my_tab");

    then the elements look like:

        <table class="my_tab">    # the entire table
        <td class="my_tab">       # normal tab
        <td class="my_tab_actv">  # active tab
        <td class="my_tab_spc">   # spacer
        <td class="my_tab_ind">   # indentation

    If you don't wrap headings, then ofcourse you won't need to specify the
    indentation td's. By the way, the indentation will usually look most
    natural if it has the same width as the spacers or a multiple thereof.
    Look at the example in the EXAMPLE section to see how this all works
    out.

   default
     default(STRING)

    Overrides which heading is the default. Normally CGI::Widget::Tabs will
    make the first heading active. Use the default() method if you want to
    deviate from this. The optional argument STRING must either be the
    heading key or the heading text, depending on how you chose to
    initialize the headings. Example:

        # Make the "Trains" heading the default active one.
        $tab->default("Trains");

        # ...or perhaps...
        $tab->default("-t");

   display
      display()

    Renders the tab widget and prints the resulting HTML to the default
    output handle (usually STDOUT). Example:

        $tab->display;       # this is the same as...

        print $tab->render;  # ...but saves a few keystrokes

    See also the render() method.

   heading
      heading()

    Creates, appends and returns a new heading. The return value will always
    be an OO heading object. Example:

        my $h = $tab->heading();

    In general you will use OO headings if the headings() method is not
    flexible enough. For trivial applications the headings() method mostly
    suffices. Look at section PROPERTIES OF OO HEADINGS for more information
    on OO headings.

   headings
      headings(LIST)

    Sets/returns the tab headings. Without arguments the currently defined
    headings are returned. If no headings are defined, the empty list is
    returned. Any returned heading will always be an OO heading, regardless
    of if and how the initializing LIST argument is used. Look at section
    PROPERTIES OF OO HEADINGS for more info on how to deal with OO headings.

    The optional LIST argument is a short-cut to the OO headings interface.
    The elements of LIST can take various forms. Let's take a moment to take
    a close look at the headings of a tab. Tab headings are the things that
    --from human perspective-- identify a tab page. Observe the spotting
    example above. Here the different tab pages are identified by the
    strings "Planes", "Trains", "Classics" and "Bikes". They form the
    heading for each seperate tab. The LIST elements can be used to preset
    these tab headings.

    An element of LIST can be any one of:

    * a string. E.g.:
            qw/Planes Trains Classics Bikes/

        This is the simplest initializer. In the spotting example the four
        tabs headings are easily created by feeding these words as a list to
        the headings() method. And then you are almost done: the headings
        can be displayed and each heading gets it's own self referencing
        URL.

    * a key/value pair. E.g.:
            ( -p => "Planes",
              -t => "Trains",
              -c => "Classics,
              -b => "Bikes" )

        For trivial CGI::Widget::Tabs applications, the k/v pairs are the
        ones you will probably use the most. They come in handy because you
        don't need to check the value returned by active() against very long
        words. Even better, if you change the tab headings (upper/lower
        case, typo's) but use the same keys you don't need to change your
        code. So it is less error prone. As a pleasant side effect, the
        URL's get to be significantly shorter. Do notice that the keys want
        to be unique. Keys in a k/v list are not at all magical. You can
        choose any string you like with the provision that they start with
        the '-' (hyphen) sign. The starting '-' of a list entry is what
        triggers CGI::Widget::Tabs to decide this is a k/v entry. Single or
        dual character strings tend to be the most convenient keys.

    * a hash
        This use of the headings() method will clutter up your code. The
        hash tries to mimic and encapsulate all OO accessor methods. If
        think you need an initializer hash, you probably want OO headings.
        Use it only if you must. If you can stick with the strings or k/v
        pairs. That said, the hash keys are the named equivalents of the OO
        heading properties. E.g.:

            ( { text  => "Planes",
                key   => "p",
                url   => "www.aviation-mag.com",
                class => "heavens_blue",
                raw   => 0 },

    You can mix these types in any way you like. The various types will be
    translated on the fly to OO headings and then processed. Thus you can
    safely say:

        $tab->headings( "Plaines",
                        -t => "Traines",
                        { text => "Classics",
                          key  => "c",
                          ... } )

    Just as the hash initializer, this use does clutter up your code. The
    reason is that different concepts of information are piled up on one big
    heep. You will need to scrutinize the code to understand what it is
    going on. Although it is supported you should refrain yourself from
    making use of these combinations.

    As a summary, here are a three examples of the headings() method for the
    spotting page.

        # Example 1: Set the headings with a list of strings
        my $tab = CGI::Widget::Tabs->new();
        $tab->headings( qw/Planes Trains Classics Bikes/ );

        # Example 2: Set the headings with a list of k/v pairs
        my $tab = CGI::Widget::Tabs->new();
        $tab->headings( -p => "Planes",
                        -t => "Trains",
                        -c => "Classics,
                        -b => "Bikes" );

        # Example 3: Isolate the "Classics" heading
        my $h = ($tab->headings)[2];

    Note that these few statements provide almost enough logic to generate
    the HTML for the tab widget!

   indent
      indent(BOOLEAN)

    Sets/returns the indentation setting. Without arguments the current
    setting is returned. indent() specifies if indentation should be added
    to the next row when the headings get wrapped. indent() is a toggle. By
    default indent() is set to TRUE. You must explicitely switch it off for
    the desired effect. The optional argument BOOLEAN can be any argument
    evaluating to a logical value.

    The purpose of swithing off indentation is to simulate a vertical menu.
    In the spotting example, running

        $tab->wrap(1);
        $tab->indent(0);

    would result in something like:

          __________
         |  Planes  |
        --------------
          __________
         |  Trains  |
        --------------
          __________
         | Classics |
        --------------
          __________
         |  Bikes   |
        --------------

    You probably need to tweak your style sheet to have it look nicely.

   render
      render()

    Renders the tab widget and returns the resulting HTML code. This is
    useful if you need to print the tab to a different file handle. Another
    use is if you want to manipulate the HTML. For instance to insert
    session id's or the like. See the class() method and the EXAMPLE section
    somewhere else in this document to see how you can influence the markup
    of the tab widget. Example:

        my $html = $tab->render;
        print HTML $html;  # there's a session id filter behind HTML

   wrap
      wrap(NUMBER)

    Sets or returns the wrap setting. Without arguments the current wrap
    setting is returned. If the argument NUMBER is given the headings will
    wrap to the next row after NUMBER headings. By default headings are not
    wrapped.

INTERNALS
  Private Class Methods
   _link
     link($text, $href)

    Returns a HTML 'a' tag pair linking to $href with text $text

INSTALLATION
    This module uses Module::Build for its installation. To install this
    module type the following:

      perl Build.PL
      ./Build
      ./Build test
      ./Build install

    If you do not have Module::Build type:

      perl Makefile.PL

    to fetch it. Or use CPAN or CPANPLUS and fetch it "manually".

DEPENDENCIES
    This module requires these other modules and libraries:

     Carp
     CGI  or  CGI::Minimal or another CGI   "object broker" with   a similar param()
     method
     HTML::Entities
     Test::More
     URI::Escape

    Test::More is only required for testing purposes.

    This module has these optional dependencies:

     File::Find::Rule
     Pod::Coverage
     Test::Pod (0.95 or higher)
     Test::Signature

    These are both just requried for testing purposes.

    Also required, a CSS stylesheet for the tabs markup

TODO
    Just because these items are in the todo list, does not mean they will
    actually be done. If you think one of these would be helpful say so -
    and it will then move up on my priority list.

    *   Provide a hash lookup as a replacement mechanism for $cgi->params()
        for those who don't use CGI or CGI::Minimal

    *   Add support for heading images instead of text

    *   Consider replacing some/all of the hand crafted get set methods with
        use of Class::MethodMaker

    *   Consider using Test::More in 003_main.t

    Patches always welcome.

BUGS
    As a side effect, the CGI query parameter to identify the tab (see the
    cgi_param() method) is always moved to the end of the query string.

    To report a bug or request an enhancement use CPAN's excellent Request
    Tracker, either via the web:

    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=CGI-Widget-Tabs>

    or via email:

    bug-cgi-widget-tabs@rt.cpan.org

CONTRIBUTIONS
    I would appreciate receiving your CSS style sheets used for the tabs
    markup. Especially if you happened to be professionally concerned with
    markup and layout. For techies like us it is not always easy to see what
    goes and what doesn't. If you send in a nice one, I will gladly bundle
    it with the next release.
