CGI::Widget::Tabs
=================



DESCRIPTION

CGI::Widget::Tabs lets you simulate tab widgets in HTML. You
could benefit from a tab widget if you want to serve only one
page. Depending on the tab selected you fetch and display the
underlying data. There are two main reasons for taking this
approach:

1. For the end user not to be directed to YAL or YAP (yet another
link / yet another page), but keep it all together: The single
point of entry paradigm.

2. As a consequence the end user deals with a more consistent and
integrated GUI. This will give a better "situational awareness"
within the application.

3. For the Perl hacker to handle multiple related data sources
within the same script environment.

As an example the following tabs could be used on a web page for
someone's spotting hobby:

      __________      __________      __________
     /  Planes  \    /  Trains  \    / Classics \
------------------------------------------------------
         _________
        /  Bikes  \
------------------------

As you can see, the headings wrap at three and a small
indentation is added to the start of the next row. The nice thing
about CGI::Widget::Tabs is that the tabs know their internal
state. So you can ask a tab for instance which heading has been
clicked by the user. This way you get instant feedback.
