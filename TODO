MUST DO

- Test for an available and valid CGI/CGI::Minimal object
  in those methods that require it (currently active() and
  render()).




WISH LIST

- Provide a hash lookup as a replacement mechanism for
  $cgi->params() for those who don't use CGI or CGI::Minimal
- Wrap tabs to the next line if they exceed a user defined number.


Patches welcome.
