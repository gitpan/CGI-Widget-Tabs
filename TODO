Must do (patches welcome)
-------------------------
- Test for an available and valid CGI/CGI::Minimal object
  in those methods that require it (currently active() and
  render()).

- Enhance the headings() interface. It should allow for future
  extensions like image and redir support.



Wish list (patches welcome)
---------------------------
- Provide a hash lookup as a replacement mechanism for
  $cgi->params() for those who don't use CGI or CGI::Minimal

- Wrap tabs to the next line if they exceed a user defined number.
