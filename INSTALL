SPECIAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

This release of CGI::Widget::Tabs has relocated Styles.pm. This
file is used by the demo script tabs-demo.pl. As such it is a
non-critical file for production use. Nevertheless, it would be
bad working ethics to leave obsolete files hanging around.

The quickest way is to locate the file Styles.pm in your current
CGI::Widget::Tabs installation directory and remove it. Then
install version 1.05 per the usual installation instructions:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Apologies for the inconvinience.
