1.0  (2002-07-09)
----------------
First release


1.1 (2002-08-07)
----------------
The leading minus sign in key/value lists is now propagated to
the query params in the URL. The reason is that you would get
bitten if you wanted to access the CGI tabs parameter directly
through the CGI object in stead of through the CGI::Tabs object.
The missing '-' would be a fall over. If you are not accessing
the tabs parameter outside the CGI::Tabs object, you are not
affected.

The space between tabs now has it's own CSS class

demo.pl has been renamed to tabs-demo.pl to avoid future
conflicts.


1.2 (2002-08-16)
----------------
- CGI::Tabs has adopted the namespace CGI::Widget::Tabs. To
  create a new tab object, now issue the statements:
      use CGI::Widget::Tabs;
      $tab = CGI::Widget::Tabs->new();

- Added the ->render() method (suggestions from
  Bodo Eing <eingb@uni-muenster.de>)

- Minor documentation changes

- Made it's first public appearance on CPAN
  (http://cpan.perl.org)
