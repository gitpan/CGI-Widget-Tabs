1.07  (2003-04-27)
------------------
    - Removed the distinction between simple headings and OO headings.
      Simple headings are now (as they should be) just a variation of
      OO headings. This greatly simplifies programming logic. One
      consequence is that the headings() method now only returns OO
      headings. (Thanks to Bernhard Schmalhofer
      <Bernhard.Schmalhofer@biomax.de> for suggestions and patches.)

    - Added a hash as optional initializer for the headings() method.
      (Thanks to Bernhard Schmalhofer <Bernhard.Schmalhofer@biomax.de>
      for suggestions and patches.)

    - Headings can now override the default CSS class using the
      class() method. (Suggested by Bernie Ledwick
      <bl@man.fwltech.com>)

    - Documentation updates



1.06.01 (2003-01-26)
--------------------
This is a maintenance release.
    - Fixed: forgot the replace my private "require" with "use"
    - Some code rearrangements.



1.06 (2003-01-16)
-----------------
    - Minor interface change as promised in the 1.05 release:
      $h->raw_text(STRING) has been superseded by
      $h->raw(BOOLEAN). For a background of the reason, see the
      BUGS section in the documentation of the 1.05 release. For
      the current workings, see the documentation in this release
      for the methods $h->text() and $h->raw().

    - Dropped the "use warnings" to support Perl <= 5.005.
      But CGI::Widget::Tabs pretends to be warning free all
      together.



1.05 (2002-12-02)
-----------------
    - Added wrapping and indentation functionality.
    - Minor documentation changes.
    - Relocated file Styles.pm. Read INSTALL for details.



1.04 (2002-11-23)
--------------------
    - Added CSS example style sheets to the demo script.



1.03.01 (2002-11-12)
--------------------
    This is a maintenance release.
    - Changed : Adopted 2 digit version numbering.
    - Changed : ->cgi_object() now checks if the passed object
                is a valid CGI or CGI::Minimal object. (Suggested
                by Bodo Eing <eingb@uni-muenster.de>)
    - Fixed   : Typo in test script (test.pl)



1.3 (2002-11-03)
----------------
    Continuous discussions with Sagar Shah
    <sagarshah@softhome.net> had made me (finally) realize that
    CGI::Widget::Tabs can't be extended without serious design
    change. (Is everybody so stubborn? Or is it just me?) Well,
    here it is Sagar :-)

    - Added an OO interface as a basis for future extensions of
      tab headings.
    - OO headings can be configured with the new methods:
          text()       HTML escaped heading text
          raw_text()   HTML unescaped heading text
          key()        Value to be used as CGI query param value
          url()        Redirection URL
    - Documentation additions, changes and fixes.
    - Small change to the layout of the HTML table displaying the
      widget
    - The test script (`make test') now supports both CGI and
      CGI::Minimal



1.2.1 (2002-09-07)
------------------
    - Fixed: uncaught undef
    - Documentation fixes (typo's, grammar, etc)
    - Documentation additions (section, coding examples, etc)
    - Minor internal code clean up
    - Added version as comment to resulting HTML
    - Added TODO



1.2 (2002-08-16)
----------------
    - CGI::Tabs has adopted the namespace CGI::Widget::Tabs. To
      create a new tab object, now issue the statements:
          use CGI::Widget::Tabs;
          $tab = CGI::Widget::Tabs->new();
    - Added the ->render() method (suggestions from
      Bodo Eing <eingb@uni-muenster.de>)
    - Minor documentation changes
    - Made it's first public appearance on CPAN
      (http://cpan.perl.org)



1.1 (2002-08-07)
----------------
    - The leading minus sign in key/value lists is now propagated
      to the query params in the URL. The reason is that you
      would get bitten if you wanted to access the CGI tabs
      parameter directly through the CGI object in stead of
      through the CGI::Tabs object. The missing '-' would be a
      fall over. If you are not accessing the tabs parameter
      outside the CGI::Tabs object, you are not affected.
    - The space between tabs now has it's own CSS class
    - demo.pl has been renamed to tabs-demo.pl to avoid future conflicts.




1.0  (2002-07-09)
----------------
    First release
