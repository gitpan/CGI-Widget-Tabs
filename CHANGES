1.04 (2002-11-23)
--------------------
    - Added CSS example style sheets to the demo script.



1.03.01 (2002-11-12)
--------------------
    This is a maintenance release.
    - Changed : Adopted 2 digit version numbering.
    - Changed : ->cgi_object() now checks if the passed object
                is a valid CGI or CGI::Minimal object. (Suggested
                by Bodo Eing <eingb@uni-muenster.de>)
    - Fixed   : Typo in test script (test.pl)



1.3 (2002-11-03)
----------------
    Continuous discussions with Sagar Shah <sagarshah@softhome.net>
    had made me (finally) realize that CGI::Widget::Tabs can't be
    extended without serious design change. (Is everybody so
    stubborn? Or is it just me?) Well, here it is Sagar :-)

    - Added an OO interface as a basis for future extensions of tab
      headings.
    - OO headings can be configured with the new methods:
          text()       HTML escaped heading text
          raw_text()   HTML unescaped heading text
          key()        Value to be used as CGI query param value
          url()        Redirection URL
    - Documentation additions, changes and fixes.
    - Small change to the layout of the HTML table displaying the
      widget
    - The test script (`make test') now supports both CGI and
      CGI::Minimal



1.2.1 (2002-09-07)
------------------
    - Fixed: uncaught undef
    - Documentation fixes (typo's, grammar, etc)
    - Documentation additions (section, coding examples, etc)
    - Minor internal code clean up
    - Added version as comment to resulting HTML
    - Added TODO



1.2 (2002-08-16)
----------------
    - CGI::Tabs has adopted the namespace CGI::Widget::Tabs. To
      create a new tab object, now issue the statements:
          use CGI::Widget::Tabs;
          $tab = CGI::Widget::Tabs->new();
    - Added the ->render() method (suggestions from
      Bodo Eing <eingb@uni-muenster.de>)
    - Minor documentation changes
    - Made it's first public appearance on CPAN
      (http://cpan.perl.org)



1.1 (2002-08-07)
----------------
    - The leading minus sign in key/value lists is now propagated to the query
      params in the URL. The reason is that you would get bitten if you wanted
      to access the CGI tabs parameter directly through the CGI object in stead
      of through the CGI::Tabs object. The missing '-' would be a fall over. If
      you are not accessing the tabs parameter outside the CGI::Tabs object,
      you are not affected. - The space between tabs now has it's own CSS class
    - demo.pl has been renamed to tabs-demo.pl to avoid future conflicts.




1.0  (2002-07-09)
----------------
    First release
